Minister for Social and Family Development
Chan has announced three key priorities for his Ministry in the Committee of Supply debate 2014.[25][26] These priorities are: (i) to maintain the currency and adequacy of Singapore's social support policies, (ii) to deliver integrated social services and (iii) to develop manpower for the social service sector.

Chan launched the first of 23 Social Service Offices to bring social assistance touch points closer to the populace.[27]

Iswaran as the Minister for Trade and Industry, and would relinquish his NTUC chief portfolio to Ng Chee Meng, effective from 1 May 2018.[32] He also took over responsibility for the Public Service Division on the same day as well.[33]

An audio leak from a closed-door meeting between Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) members and minister Chan Chun Sing on 18 February 2020 revealed that Chan had used the derogatory hokkien term "sia suay" (meaning causing embarrassment or disgrace) to describe Singaporeans who were panic buying.[34]

In late May 2020, Chan gave a video interview in which he sought to explain why Singapore was heavily reliant on foreign trade. He cited face masks as an example of a product which Singapore could not produce itself, explaining that "[we] don't have too many sheep in Singapore to produce cotton".[35] Online commentators were quick to point out that cotton is produced by cotton plants rather than from sheep. On 1 June 2020, Chan published a Facebook post apologising for his gaffe and clarified: "To any one (especially young children) watching the video – cotton definitely doesn’t come from sheep, it comes from cotton plants!".[36][37]

Another audio leak happened two days before the 2020 general election. In early July 2020, The Online Citizen published an article along with an audio clip of a speech made by Chan. In the audio clip, Chan mentioned the PAP's results during elections and the restricting space access north of Seletar Airport. Chan later wrote on Facebook that the speech took place in 2019 at a closed-door conversation held after Malaysia imposing a restricted flying zone north of Seletar Airport. He claimed that the audio clip was leaked and circulated for "ill-intent".[38][39][40] Following the General Election, Chan retained his portfolio. Following a Cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 2021, Chan was suceeded by Gan Kim Yong as Minister for Trade and Industry.

Minister for Education

Chan also announced the removal of Common Last Topics from the GCE N, O and A-Levels, and some topics from the final year examinations "to help ease stress" as well as a proposed buddy system to be implemented in schools later on.[43][44][45] In April 2024, Singapore was selected to host the 14th International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP) for the first time.[46] Chan gave a Welcome Address on the first Day of the summit.
