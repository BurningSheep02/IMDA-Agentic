       "'<p>The secret of this Cantonese favourite, apparently largely unknown in Singapore itself, is, as so often with noodles, speed: if you’ve only thus far enjoyed it after it’s spent 20 minutes on the back of a scooter, eating it hot straight from the wok, rather than clumped together in a plastic takeaway container, will be a revelation. It’s easily made meat-free and gluten-free, too.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>6 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>2</strong></p> <p><strong>125g rice vermicelli<br>1 handful </strong><strong>green beans<br>2 garlic cloves<br>4cm piece root ginger<br>1 bird’s eye or other hot chilli<br>2 spring onions<br>2½ tsp curry powder<br>6 water chestnuts<br>5 </strong><strong>shiitake mushrooms<br>½ red pepper<br>1 handful </strong><strong>peas</strong> – frozen are fine<br><strong>3 tbsp gluten-free soy sauce<br>2 tbsp rice wine</strong>, or dry sherry<br><strong>A pinch of sugar<br>50g char siu pork</strong>, or cooked chicken<br><strong>1 egg</strong><br><strong>A splash of sesame oil<br>50g prawns</strong>, defrosted if necessary<br><strong>2 tbsp peanut oil</strong>, or other neutral oil<br><strong>1 handful chopped coriander</strong>, to serve (optional)</p> <h2>1 Get organised</h2> <p>Because it comes together so quickly at the end, you need to have all your ingredients prepared before you fire up the wok (you could use a large frying pan instead, but a wok will make life easier), otherwise you’ll end up with a gluey, overcooked mess. I’d suggest reading the recipe right through while you boil the kettle for the noodles.</p>    <h2>2 Blanch the noodles, then drain</h2> <p>Put the vermicelli in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave for 30-45 seconds, until softened, but not totally soft, then drain and leave to dry in a sieve or colander while you prepare the other ingredients; toss the noodles occasionally, to ensure they don’t clump together. Top and tail the beans.</p> <h2>3 Prep the garlic, ginger and chilli</h2>    <p>Peel and crush the garlic and ginger, and put them in a small bowl. Trim and finely chop the chilli (remove the seeds, if you’re sensitive to heat, or add another chilli, if you enjoy it), and add to the bowl. Trim the spring onions, slice both white and green parts diagonally, then put these in the bowl and add half the curry powder.</p> <h2>4 Prep the remaining veg</h2>    <p>Drain and slice the water chestnuts, if necessary, trim and finely slice the mushrooms and pepper, and put both in a bowl with the peas. Substitute other veg to suit your tastes here, bearing in mind that you might need to blanch crunchier ones such as broccoli or carrot along with the beans in the next step, or to fully cook things such as pumpkin first.</p> <h2>5 Blanch the green beans</h2> <p>Blanch the beans in a small pan of boiling water for a minute, then drain and add to the other vegetables. In a second bowl, toss the noodles with the remaining teaspoon and a quarter of curry powder, soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, and a pinch of sugar, until well coated. Put both bowls near the hob.</p> <h2>6 Chop any meat</h2>    <p>You don’t need to use meat, but Singapore noodles are a great way to stretch leftovers. Shred or cut any meat you’re using into chunks and put it next to the two bowls. (You could even make some char siu pork the day before, keeping back a little for this purpose – chef Jeremy Pang has <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/char-siu-bbq-pork\">a straightforward recipe on the BBC Good Food website</a>.)</p> <h2>7 Crack the egg and get any seafood ready</h2>    <p>Crack the egg into a cup and beat with a pinch of salt and a dash of sesame oil. Put this near the hob, along with the prawns – you can use raw or cooked (raw will need to go in the wok a little before the meat, to start cooking), or another seafood such as chunks of crabmeat or drained tinned mussels, if you prefer.</p> <h2>8 Start cooking</h2>    <p>Put the oil in a wok set over a high heat until smoking, then add the garlic and ginger mixture. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds, until fragrant, then tip in all the vegetables and stir-fry for a couple of minutes. Push all the veg to one side of the wok, tip the beaten egg into the other side, leave it to cook undisturbed, until almost set, then scramble into the vegetables.</p>    <h2>9 Finishing touches</h2> <p>Add the meat and prawns to the pan, then tip in the noodles and toss everything together for a couple of minutes (tongs are useful here), so all the various ingredients are well distributed among the noodles.</p>    <!-- Recipe element -->  <p>Heap on to a serving plate, top with chopped coriander, if using, and serve immediately.</p>'"

       "['A judicial inquiry into bribery and corruption at the highest levels of Malta’s previous government has completed its work and made recommendations of criminal charges.The investigating magistrate, Charmaine Galea, is understood to have completed her inquiry into corruption allegations concerning a wide array of individuals, including the former government energy minister, the chief of staff to former prime minister Joseph Muscat, and a businessman awaiting trial for allegedly masterminding the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.Jason Azzopardi, a lawyer representing politicians from the opposition Nationalist party, who requested the inquiry, confirmed reports in the Maltese press that the investigating magistrate had finished her work. “It is massive. From the little information I have, it is another watershed moment,” Azzopardi said.The report is due to go to Malta’s attorney general, who will take the decision on whether anyone should be arraigned and on what charges.Maltese government sources, however, denied reports that the inquiry was finished; it was “definitely not closed”, one source told Malta Today, one of the newspapers that first reported the story. The Guardian has contacted the office of Malta’s prime minister and the ministry for justice for comment.The magistrate is understood to have recommended charges of bribery and money laundering against some individuals.The investigation centres on a government contract to run a gas power station, one of Malta’s main sources of electricity.The contract was awarded to Electrogas, where Yorgen Fenech, the businessman awaiting trial for masterminding the murder of Caruana Galizia, was a shareholder and director. The magistrate’s inquiry has examined the contract, and looked into secret companies in Dubai alleged to be linked to Keith Schembri, who was chief of staff to the prime minister from 2013, and to Konrad Mizzi, energy minister at the time.Muscat resigned as prime minister in December 2019, days after Mizzi and Schembri had been forced to quit as the political crisis around Caruana Galizia’s murder escalated.Karol Aquilina, an opposition MP, called for the immediate publication of the report and urged the attorney general to follow up on its conclusions in the “shortest possible time”.Schembri and Mizzi did not respond to messages requesting a comment.Caruana Galizia, Malta’s foremost investigative journalist, reported in 2016 that Mizzi and Schembri were the owners of secretive offshore companies in Panama. A year later, she also revealed the existence of a Dubai company, 17 Black Limited, owned by Fenech. Months later, in October 2017, she was assassinated outside her home in a car bombing. She had been examining a leak of internal company files and emails from Electrogas at the time of her death.After her death, investigative reporters who took up her work for the Daphne project linked 17 Black and another Dubai company, Macbridge Ltd, to Mizzi and Schembri.Fenech was subsequently charged with complicity in Caruana Galizia’s murder. He pleaded not guilty and the case continues.In 2018, Schembri denied any knowledge of payments to the Dubai companies, 17 Black and Macbridge. But he admitted that both firms, which are registered in Dubai, “were included in draft business plans [as] potential clients”.Mizzi said in 2018 there was no connection, “direct or otherwise”, between himself and any entity called 17 Black.The investigation follows a separate decision to charge Muscat, Malta’s former prime minister, with corruption in relation to a hospital privatisation scandal.The former Labour leader has dismissed those charges as a smear campaign built on fantasies and lies.That investigation focuses on a decision by Muscat’s government in 2015 to pass the management of three public hospitals to a private company, Vitals Global Healthcare, in a deal conservatively estimated to be worth €4bn (£3.4bn). Schembri and Mizzi also stand accused of bribery and money laundering in the case. The two men have denied any wrongdoing.',\n",
       " 'The Chinese Communist party has expelled two former defence ministers for corruption, including Li Shangfu, who disappeared from public view along with other senior figures last year.Li was sacked as defence minister in October, two months after he disappeared from public life. He served just seven months as defence minister. No explanation was given for his sudden removal, which temporarily destabilised efforts to rebuild US-China defence dialogues.On Thursday, Chinese state media said that Li and Wei Fenghe, another former defence minister, had been expelled from the CCP for “serious violation of party discipline and the law”. The accusations against the two men include accepting gifts and money and facilitating improper benefits for others.The allegations are the result of a months-long investigation by the central military commission.State media said that Li’s and Wei’s cases would be transferred to the prosecutorial wing of the military for criminal charges.Wei was defence minister immediately before Li, having served since 2018. He previously led the rocket force, a sensitive arm of the military responsible for China’s nuclear arsenal. Wei had also largely disappeared from public events.Last year brought a series of dramatic reshuffles in China’s military leadership, including in the rocket force, where two top generals were replaced with men from other parts of the armed forces. Analysts said that this suggested an attempt to break patronage networks in the unit.In December, three senior aerospace and defence industry executives were removed from a top CCP advisory body.Qin Gang, a former foreign minister who has not been seen in public for a year, was also sacked without explanation last year after a brief stint in office.Xi Jinping, China’s president and head of the military, has made anti-corruption a cornerstone of his leadership since coming to power in 2012. But the numerous purges last year have raised questions about the efficacy of his graft-busting campaign. Some of the senior figures to be axed, such as Li, Wei and Qin, were appointed with Xi’s approval.People purged from the senior ranks of the CCP may be left to live their remaining years in political and social exile, or they may face harsher criminal penalties. Last month a court sentenced to death Bai Tianhui, a former general manager of China Huarong International Holdings, a bank, for accepting bribes of more than 1.1bn yuan (£110m).The military purge is thought to be related to an investigation announced last year into corruption in military procurement. Li was head of the equipment procurement department between 2017 and 2022.The expulsions of Li and Wei will be officially confirmed when the CCP’s central committee has its long-delayed third plenum next month. On Thursday, it was announced that the meeting of top CCP leaders would take place on 15-18 July.',\n",
       " 'Support for democracy is falling in Africa amid a string of military coups and dissatisfaction with corruption and mismanagement, according to a report by Afrobarometer. However, Africans still have a stronger preference for democratic governance than many parts of the world.Two-thirds of people in 30 African countries prefer democracy, surveys conducted in 2021 or 2023 found, down seven percentage points from a decade earlier.There have been eight successful military takeovers in Africa since 2020, mostly in west Africa in what has become known as the “coup belt”. The last few years have also seen an increase in protests against tax rises and subsidy cuts by the continent’s increasingly youthful population, often in countries where leaders are also seen as corrupt.South Africa saw the steepest drop in support for democracy, with those agreeing that “democracy is preferable to any other kind of government” falling 29 percentage points to 43%, amid chronically high unemployment, failing public services and graft scandals.In Mali, which is ruled by a military junta after coups in 2020 and 2021, only 39% of respondents rated democracy above other forms of government, down 23 percentage points from 10 years ago. Meanwhile, disapproval of military rule plunged from 70% to just 18%.The report by Afrobarometer, a pan-African survey organisation, said: “Africans’ preference for democracy remains resilient to deterioration on many indicators of socioeconomic performance. Instead, shifts in popular support over the past decade are related to changes in political conditions such as declining election quality, increasing levels of corruption and failure to promote the rule of law.”The surveys found Africans have also become less satisfied with the way democracy works in their countries over the last decade, with the growing discontent linked to perceptions that economic conditions have worsened and that corruption and impunity have increased.The biggest falls in satisfaction were in some of the continent’s most stable democracies – South Africa, Botswana and Mauritius. Meanwhile, more citizens said they were happy with the way democracy was working in six countries, including Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Morocco.Young people on the continent are more likely to support military rule. “A combination of trust in the military, frustration with poor governance, and waning (or lacking) memories of the harsh realities experienced during a previous era of military governments may be chipping away at resistance to this particular form of authoritarian rule,” the report said.Despite the poor performance of many elected governments, Africans still prefer democracy to a greater extent than people in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, it said.Zambia, where voters booted out Edgar Lungu in 2021 after the country defaulted on its debts and inflation soared, topped the table in its preference for democracy. Ethiopia, which experienced a devastating civil war from 2020 to 2022, was in second place, followed by Senegal, which elected an anti-establishment president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, in March after his predecessor, Macky Sall, tried to delay the vote to the end of the year.',\n",

       " 'Malta’s former prime minister Joseph Muscat has been charged with corruption in a hospital privatisation scandal that was once investigated by the murdered investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.Muscat has been charged with accepting bribes, corruption in public office and money laundering, according to documents seen by AFP. He has described the allegations as “fantasies and lies” and said he was the victim of a political vendetta.Chris Fearne, Malta’s deputy prime minister, who is tipped to become Malta’s next European commissioner, and the country’s former finance minister Edward Scicluna, who is now the governor of Malta’s central bank, were charged with fraud, misappropriation and fraudulent gain.Fearne, who was health minister at the time of the privatisation deal under investigation, said he had “absolutely no doubt that the court will find nothing other than my complete innocence”. Scicluna has not commented on the accusations, but has previously denied any wrongdoing.Muscat’s former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and Konrad Mizzi, a former minister, face charges including money laundering, soliciting bribes and corruption. Both men have denied the accusations.The charges are part of a longrunning investigation into a decision by Muscat’s then Labour government in 2015 to pass the management of three public hospitals to a private company, Vitals Global Healthcare, in a deal conservatively estimated at €4bn (£3.4bn).Caruana Galizia, a crusading investigative journalist, had written about the deal before her assassination in a car bombing in 2017.In February 2024 a court annulled the privatisation deal between the Maltese government and Vitals Global Healthcare, later Steward Health Care, finding evidence of fraudulent behaviour. Responding to that decision, the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation said the judgment vindicated her “extensive reporting about the fraudulent deal”.Caruana Galizia, who reported widely on corruption across the political spectrum on the Mediterranean island, was killed outside her home in October 2017, sending shock waves across Europe. An independent inquiry in 2019 found no evidence of government involvement in the assassination but said the state had to bear responsibility for creating “a culture of impunity”. ‘I knew it was a car bomb straight away’: the day my mother Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered Malta’s prime minister, Robert Abela, who succeeded Muscat as leader of the country’s Labour party, has raised doubts about the corruption investigation, questioning the timing of the charges, one month before European parliament elections. He suggested “the establishment” was seeking to “steal the sovereignty” of Malta’s leadership.He told a press conference on Monday: “Everyone will have the opportunity to determine whether or not the magistrate’s inquiry began with the presumption of guilt. I hope that this is not the case.”In response, Bernard Grech, the opposition Nationalist party leader, accused Abela of choosing “to stand alongside the aggressor instead of the victims … he chose his colleagues instead of Malta and the Maltese”.Repubblika, the civil society group, said: “The prime minister’s conduct amounts to a gross assault on judicial independence and the rule of law. We will resist this attack.”On Tuesday, Muscat denied the allegations, writing on Facebook: “If they weren’t so serious, [they] would be laughable.”He added: “Without even questioning me, the authorities decided to smear me and accuse me of corruption, money laundering, establishing a criminal organisation, and even claiming I took €30m. It will be my pleasure to dismantle each of these accusations and show how they are not built just on fantasies, but also on lies.”',\n",
       " 'Human rights watchdogs have condemned the arrest of a journalist in Malawi in connection with an article accusing a wealthy businessman of corruption.Police in Blantyre detained Macmillan Mhone on Monday over a story that was published online last August on the Malawi 24 news site.The 34-year-old reporter has been charged with “publication of news likely to cause fear and public alarm; cyber-spamming; and extortion” and released on bail. Mhone’s story, which has not been taken down from the website, reported allegations that Abdul Karim Batatawala was operating a network of proxy companies to secure Malawi’s government contracts while he was awaiting trial on allegations of corrupt practices.Batatawala is facing criminal allegations of fraud and corruption. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. Mhone’s article included his denial that he had used proxy companies.Mhone reported that Batatawala was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in 2021 on suspicion of fraud and money laundering for the Malawi government.In a statement, the Malawi police service public relations officer Peter Kalaya said Mhone had been arrested after a complaint by Batatawala that efforts had been made by the journalist to extort money from him.But the deputy chair of the Human Rights Defenders Coalition, Gift Trapence, condemned the charges against Mhone.Trapence said: “The rights of journalists must be respected, any attempts to suppress their freedom to report must be met with swift and appropriate condemnation.”Mhone’s lawyer Joseph Lihoma questioned the police decision to take the journalist 200 miles from Blantyre to Malawi’s main police headquarters in the capital, Lilongwe, to charge him.“There is no justification for the transfer. The prosecution could take place in Blantyre instead of hundreds of kilometres away,” he said.In a statement, the Malawi chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa) criticised both the arrest and the transfer from Blantyre.“This conduct amounts to torture and deliberate attempt to intimate the journalist,” said Golden Matonga, Misa’s chairperson.He said the article did not in any way cause fear or public alarm and demanded that the charges be dropped. “We believe that arresting and detaining a journalist over a story is a violation of media freedom and the public’s rights to know,” Misa’s statement read.Undule Mwakasungula, a commentator on governance, said: “When journalists fear arrest for their reporting, it discourages investigative journalism and critical reporting. This could create a breeding ground for increased corruption, undermining the rule of law and human rights abuses.” French journalist arrested in Ethiopia accused of ‘conspiracy to create chaos’ Malawi’s president, Lazarus Chakwera, has vowed to protect press freedom in the country. Last May he gave a speech saying: “It is after all stated in our constitution that the press shall have the right to report and publish freely within Malawi and abroad, and to be accorded the fullest possible facilities for access to public information.”In April 2022, a reporter for the Platform for Investigative Journalism, Gregory Gondwe, was detained in an attempt to force him to disclose his sources in a story about allegations that the government was doing business with UK-based Malawian businessman Zuneth Sattar.In February, this year, Gondwe went into hiding after threats from the Malawi Defence Force to arrest him over his article about allegations that millions of dollars were paid to a firm linked to Sattar while he was being investigated by the ACB and by the UK’s National Crime Agency. Sattar has not been charged and denies wrongdoing.',\n",
       " 'The New South Wales government will refer claims of serious misconduct by a senior planning bureaucrat to the corruption watchdog Icac after concerns were raised by a former Coalition minister speaking under parliamentary privilege.The Liberal MP for Wahroonga, Alister Henskens, on Thursday evening told parliament he had received “credible evidence” to suggest the planning department official had used insider information for personal gain through the government’s housing plan.Henskens said documents showed that around the time the National Housing Accord was signed and before the state government’s Transport Oriented Development (Tod) scheme was announced, a public servant bought a home in an area to be rezoned under the policy and attempted to form a “property syndicate”.Henskens claimed shortly after purchasing the north shore property, the planning official spoke with neighbours about “banding together to sell their properties to a developer promising a significant uplift on its current value because of the government’s likely housing policies”. Woolworths, Coles and Aldi to roll out soft plastics collection bins in 12 Melbourne stores “There is credible evidence that in the course of communications, the planning official has used confidential information before it has come into the public domain and passed that information on to residents in an attempt to make them become part of a property syndicate that the public official wants to put together.”Henskens claimed the official paid over the suburb median for the home.“There are reasons to conclude that the property was not purchased for the needs of the planning department official as the person’s previous property appeared suitable for their immediate needs,” Henskens said in parliament.“A strong circumstantial case that the property’s acquisition was motivated by inside information as to the planned Tod policy can be made out.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundupHenskens said the claims were backed up by a “discussion with a whistleblower with relevant knowledge corroborated by documents”. The MP said the whistleblower would cooperate with an investigation into the claims.On Friday morning, the NSW planning minister, Paul Scully, said the government would not tolerate corruption of any kind and would be referring Henskens’s statement to the Independent Commission Against Corruption.“There is absolutely no place for the kind of actions being alleged by the member for Wahroonga,” he said.The minister said all allegations of corruption should be reported to Icac.The premier, Chris Minns, urged Henskens to cooperate with Icac and said the body was best placed to deal with the allegations.“The NSW government takes allegations of corruption extremely seriously, particularly in the planning department,” he said.“I would urge anyone, including that member, who had any information, to provide it to Icac as soon as possible so that we can ensure there’s a full and thorough investigation.”Minns said Icac was proven to be able to “root out corruption precisely of the variety that’s been alleged”.Henskens said any inquiry needed to be public and “conducted immediately”.“If the government fails to get such assurances, then it needs to use its powers to urgently commission an independent judge with wide-ranging powers to conduct a full public inquiry,” he said on Friday.The Tod scheme was announced in December as the Minns government’s signature housing policy.The first phase of the scheme would see the rezoning of land within 1.2km of the stations at Bankstown, Bays West, Bella Vista, Crows Nest, Homebush, Hornsby, Kellyville and Macquarie Park.The second tranche would see new planning controls applied to precincts within 400 metres of 31 train stations “which will allow the development of more multi-storey housing”.•  On 18 March 2024, Icac cleared the planning official of any wrongdoing and closed its investigation. Icac said there was no evidence the planning official or any other person engaged in corrupt conduct.',\n",
       " 'Like many people, I have had Covid and I have had long Covid. They are very different experiences. I first caught the disease at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, when its effects were relatively unknown. It was unnerving and highly unpredictable. I did not get particularly sick, but I probably gave the virus to my father, who did. Back then, Covid appeared to be the great divider – the old were far more at risk than the young, and those with pre-existing vulnerabilities most at risk of all – and the great equaliser. Almost everyone experienced the shock and the fear of discovering a novel killer among us. We soon acquired a shared language and a sense of common purpose: to get through this together – whatever  turned out to be.I developed long Covid last year, six months after I had caught glandular fever. The fresh bout of the Covid virus made the effects of the glandular fever far worse: more debilitating and much harder to shake. Some mornings it was a struggle to get out of bed, never mind leave the house. It was as though Covid latched on to what was already wrong with me and gave it extra teeth. The experience was unpredictable in a very different way from the drama of getting sick in 2020: not a cosmic lottery, but a drawn-out bout of low-level, private misery. Good days were followed by bad days for no obvious reason, hopes of having recovered were snuffed out just when it seemed like the worst was past. Long Covid is less isolating than being locked down, but it is also a lonelier business than getting ill at the peak of the pandemic was, if only\\xa0because other people have moved on. Rage, waste and corruption: how Covid changed politics – podcast The physical and psychological effects of these different versions of Covid – the short and the long – are oddly parallel to its political consequences. The disease turns out to be its own metaphor. We are all suffering from political long Covid now. The early drama is over. A series of lingering misfortunes has replaced it. As with long Covid, different countries are suffering in different ways, trapped in their own private miseries. The shock\\xa0of the new has gone, to be replaced by an enduring sense of fatigue.When the pandemic hit, its effects on politics were intensely felt and hard to predict. In some ways, it seemed like the ultimate stress test. Different political systems – and leaders – were exposed in different ways. Those with longstanding vulnerabilities seemed destined to fail. At the same time, the advent of Covid appeared to open up the prospect of new kinds of political solidarity. We were in this together. Covid’s global impact was a reminder of what it is that we all have in common. An acute awareness of our shared vulnerability might create the conditions for a renewed sense of purpose in tackling global problems, including the climate emergency. Maybe a pandemic was just what we needed to remember what was at stake, and to remind some of us how lucky we are.Four years on, the picture looks very different. The immediate experience of the pandemic feels more and more remote, even though public inquiries are now under way, trying to establish just what really happened and who was to blame for what went wrong. Part of the reason for the remoteness is that much of what once looked like high-stakes decision-making has come out in the wash: many outcomes were similar, regardless of the political choices that were made. Maybe it was in the lap of the gods after all.At the same time, the more pernicious but harder to recognise political consequences of Covid are all around us. The immediacy of the threat has passed, but the lingering signs of the damage it did to the body politic are everywhere. The pandemic and its consequences – lockdowns, economic dislocation, inflation, growing frustration with political elites – have found out pre-existing weaknesses in our politics and made them worse. It has given what ails us extra teeth.The early days of Covid gave reason to hope that the massive disruption it entailed might also shift the direction of travel of global politics. That hope turned out to be illusory. In the first phase of the pandemic, it looked to have exposed populist grandstanding for what it was: bleach, it turned out, was no sort of viral disinfectant. But populism remains on the rise around the world, feeding off the many discontents of the lockdown years, and of the years that preceded them.Likewise, Covid did not start any major wars – 2020\\xa0and 2021 were two of the most peaceful years for international conflict on record. But a post-Covid world is now as militarily dangerous as at any time since the cold war.Covid did not exacerbate climate breakdown: for a short while, carbon emissions fell as economies shut down. But the world is still getting warmer and the hope that tackling the virus would provide a model for more urgent climate action turns out to have been a pipe dream.The pandemic wormed its way into the weak spots in our political life, just as long Covid finds weaknesses in the human body. It no longer galvanises us, nor is it capable of destroying us. Instead, its symptoms are erratic and hard to fathom, appearing in surprising and seemingly unrelated places. Political long Covid is\\xa0neither the great divider nor the great equaliser. It’s\\xa0the great destabiliser.During 2020, when the pandemic forced governments around the world to improvise their responses at breakneck speed, it looked as though it would expose some basic truths about the strengths and weaknesses of different political systems. The biggest and most immediate contrast was between autocratic China and the democratic west. Ruthlessness and decisiveness – which the Chinese political system appeared to possess in abundance – were the order of the day. The\\xa0democracies struggled to keep up.In March of that year, after Italy became the first European country to grapple with the question of how to keep its population from infecting one another, the Chinese sent a group of health officials to help advise. The Italians were concerned by the fact that, despite putting draconian lockdowns in place, the virus was still spreading. The Chinese explained the problem. These weren’t actually lockdowns as they understood them. People could still leave their homes for emergencies, enforcement was sporadic, and punishment was relatively light. Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the very centre of the Covid outbreak, armed guards stood outside apartment blocks, curfews were brutally enforced and those with the virus could be barricaded inside their homes. Within a matter of weeks, Italy’s death toll was more than double that of China’s.The biggest contrast with China was the US, where a federal system of executive decision-making, a widespread suspicion of government mandates and an incompetent president meant that Covid soon killed far more people than anywhere else. If the US was the flagship for democracy, then it looked like democracy was failing to answer the call.However, it quickly became clear that the global picture was more complicated than any hastily assembled political morality tale might suggest. New Zealand – democratic, liberal and with a robustly independent population – for a long time kept the virus almost completely at bay. The country had the advantage of being an island state that was able to shut its borders. But Britain is also an island, and that made no difference to the government’s ability – or inability – to act. Vietnam, which is not an island, did almost as well as New Zealand. Russia did almost as badly as the US. Some of the worst death tolls were in the countries of eastern Europe, such as Bulgaria and Serbia, which had a mixed legacy of authoritarianism and democracy. Dividing the world up by regime types proved little.Demography turned out to be as important as politics: elderly, unhealthy populations suffered more. Equally, any geopolitical morality tales concealed a more complex set of tradeoffs. A zero-Covid policy, ruthlessly enforced as in China, turned out to be storing up trouble for the future. Even with the advent of effective vaccines – and China’s homegrown versions turned out to be less effective than elsewhere – too many of China’s population remained unprotected from the virus and the much-delayed economic opening left them exposed. China has also displayed a longstanding weakness of autocratic systems: an absence of transparency means we don’t know the ultimate death toll there, because they are not telling. It is simply not possible to compare it with other countries.The wider tradeoffs – the toll that lockdowns have taken on mental health, on treatment for other illnesses, on educational prospects for the children worst affected – make it hard to draw any clear political lessons. Sweden, which was heralded – and viciously derided – for providing a real-time experiment in the efficacy of non-lockdown policies, now presents as mixed a picture as anywhere else: more Covid-related deaths than its Scandinavian neighbours (2,576 deaths per million, compared with Denmark’s 1,630 and Norway’s 1,054) but similar or even lower overall excess mortality rates from all causes, and less educational and economic disruption, though no readily quantifiable economic benefits. Covid was not just a political stress test. It was\\xa0a series of impossible choices.Four years on, it is also clear that many of the lasting political consequences of the virus have little to do with the relative performance of individual governments. In the UK, the long-term incumbent parties north and south of the border are suffering serious Covid fallout despite adopting opposed approaches to the pandemic. The Tories in Westminster were reluctant lockdowners, the SNP in Edinburgh far more enthusiastic ones. It made little odds for the final outcomes: overall mortality rates were relatively consistent for the UK as a whole and variations had more to do with the underlying population profiles in different parts of the country than with the policy preferences of elected politicians.What lingers is something more familiar: the whiff of corruption and the stench of hypocrisy. Although Rishi Sunak, as chancellor, was responsible for one of the more hare-brained schemes of 2020, “eat out to help out” – which gave diners discounts for getting back into pubs and restaurants, at a time when the virus was still widespread in the population and about to surge back – that is not the reason why he is in such deep political trouble. Instead, the Covid legacy that haunts the Tories stems almost entirely from the parties held in Downing Street during Boris Johnson’s premiership, when the rest of the country was still locked down. Ultimately it is not the contrast between the public performance of different administrations that has come to matter politically, but the contrast between public pronouncements and private practice: not how\\xa0many died in the end, but how many died while the wine was flowing in Downing Street. Hypocrisy is\\xa0the political killer.The same is true for the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon, who once appeared caring and decisive in her nightly news conference, now seems sanctimonious and evasive, her WhatsApp messages long deleted, her personal grievances exposed. The harsh light of a public inquiry has revealed the SNP to have been as motivated by\\xa0petty point-scoring and score-settling as any other self-interested political party.Politics everywhere – in whatever form – takes its toll on its practitioners. The scars accumulate, especially for longstanding administrations. Covid, initially, appeared to be something else: an unprecedented governmental challenge, requiring a new kind of skill set. But in the end, it found a way to expose the regime fatigue that had set in regardless. As Johnson and Sturgeon have discovered, long political Covid is a lonelier business than the exposure they faced in the white heat of the initial outbreak. It works its way through to latch on to personal vulnerabilities and makes them far harder to shake off.What happened to the sense of solidarity that the arrival of Covid appeared to have engendered? In the early days of the pandemic, many governments – including in the UK – were worried that people would soon tire of restrictions on their freedom of movement. Some behavioural models had indicated that widespread disobedience would become the norm after a matter of weeks. Those models turned out to be wrong. Most citizens around the world did as they were told for far longer than might have been expected.This gave rise to a hope that concerted action on an equivalent scale might be possible in other areas, too. If, in the face of a serious threat, the public was willing to act in the common interest, even if that meant making significant personal sacrifices, then perhaps other collective action problems – from mass migration to the climate crisis – might be amenable to a similar spirit of cooperation. Maybe we were more public-spirited than we had given ourselves credit for.Yet no such dividend has been delivered. On the most contentious political questions, we remain as far apart as ever. Environmental policies – particularly when tied to net zero targets – still provoke deep divisions and can stoke widespread anger. A voting public that was so furious with Johnson over breaking his own Covid rules that it effectively helped turf him out of office nonetheless elected a Tory in his Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency when the party turned the issue of the Ulez traffic levy being introduced by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, into a symbol of bureaucratic meddling in the affairs of local communities. Lockdown was one thing. But environmental protections are something else: readily weaponised as evidence of elite interference in\\xa0ordinary people’s lives.Anti-immigrant sentiment, including among many of the older voters who most dutifully complied with Covid restrictions, continues to fuel populism around the developed world. Geert Wilders won the popular vote in last year’s Dutch general election on a platform that combined migrant-bashing with net zero scepticism. But unlike some other far-right politicians, Wilders is no Covid sceptic. He had also been one of the first Dutch politicians to complain about his country’s slow rollout of its Covid vaccination programme.Why does Covid solidarity not translate to other areas? In part, it is the lack of any comparable sense of urgency. Net zero targets are there to stave off long-heralded but also long-distant threats of catastrophe. At its height, Covid threatened to crash public health systems in a matter of days. But there is another difference. Public support for government restrictions during Covid was about controlling collective behaviour when it threatened our personal safety. The danger was other people: keep them in to keep us safe. Climate action is so much harder to sell because it seems to represent an infringement of personal freedom for the sake of some far less immediate collective benefit. In that sense, Covid compliance has more in common with anti-immigrant sentiment. Keep them out to keep us safe.Throughout the pandemic, public opinion in the UK tended to be critical of the government for being too eager to lift restrictions rather than too keen to impose them. In a pandemic the majority of British people want other people to be told what to do, even if it means being told what to do themselves.This has not been the case everywhere. In large parts of the US, the public proved deeply resistant to the many varieties of mandated behaviour, particularly when it came to mask-wearing, which became a proxy for a whole host of other resentments and frustrations. The pandemic latched on to what unites us and what divides us. It did nothing to change the contours of those divisions.The truth is that public cooperation during Covid did not reveal civic capabilities of which we had been unaware. Publics obeyed the injunctions of democratic politicians because those politicians were already doing their best to respond to the choices of the public. Successfully observed lockdowns were as much a reflection of ongoing behaviour as they were a constraint upon it. Likewise, when lockdowns failed, it was often because political leaders, themselves pandering to perceived public opinion, failed to endorse them wholeheartedly.Covid didn’t generate the political response required to change the way we live. In most cases, it gave us the political response that we asked for.The area where Covid made the biggest immediate political difference was in public finance. Politicians suddenly found the money that was needed to stave off disaster, conjuring it up any way they could. The magic money tree turned out to exist after all. In a genuine crisis, despite everything that had been said about the insurmountable limits on public spending, there proved to be both a will and a way to surmount them.As chancellor in 2020, Sunak launched a furlough scheme that guaranteed 80% subsidies to almost everyone in employment: the closest the UK has ever come to instituting a kind of universal basic income. In the US, a rolling series of extensive relief and stimulus packages included direct cash payments to all households, mortgage relief, tax holidays and giant subsidies to businesses. As a result, people stayed in work and businesses stayed afloat, while public debt in both countries soared. At the same time, governments around the world spent heavily to support vaccine development programmes. Conventional practice in the pharmaceutical industry meant there was invariably a multi-year gap between finding a new treatment and bringing it to market. But again, these constraints turned out to be dispensable. Effective vaccines arrived within a year of the outbreak.Was this, then, the model for an alternative political future, in which vastly accelerated public spending can drive innovation while protecting citizens from disruption? Could it be the means of tackling the climate crisis?In reality, the response to Covid was less like a trial run for a new climate politics and more like the response to a war. The emergency measures were put in place for the attritional phase of the pandemic, when the threat of collapse was real. They have been steadily wound down ever since. Meanwhile, the spending on vaccine research was only a part of wider government programmes that tended to be far less efficient and highly wasteful. As in any actual war, successful weapons programmes are the exception, not the norm. Most of the money gets siphoned off by schemes that go nowhere.As a result, the legacy of government action on Covid has been lingering dissatisfaction rather than a new sense of political possibility. The symptoms of political long Covid include public frustration with the bill that has to be paid. Part of the cause for that frustration is widespread inflation, stoked by looser public finances, which has fuelled anger with governments around the world and created electoral volatility. Javier Milei might not be president of Argentina without Covid-fuelled inflation. Donald Trump might not be making a comeback without it, either.At the same time, stories of the waste and corruption that inevitably went along with unfettered government spending continue to surface. In the UK, the face of government pandemic spending is not Kate Bingham, the head of the highly effective UK vaccines taskforce, but the Tory peer Michelle Mone, who is accused of having used a VIP fast-lane to bypass standard procurement processes and secure government contracts for a company to supply PPE worth more than £200m, much of which apparently turned out to be useless (though the company denies this).The price of sidelining politics as normal is that\\xa0when politics as normal resumes, the corner-cutting doesn’t look so good.In the aftermath of the first and second world wars, when government spending among the belligerents was colossal, and waste and corruption were widespread, lasting social transformation nonetheless followed in their wake. The foundations of a new kind of welfare state were laid by the scale of wartime public investment, along with a sense that public sacrifices needed to be repaid.The pandemic has not been the same. In part, it is a question of scale. The $12bn the US federal government spent supporting vaccine research is a drop in the ocean of public spending. Even the trillions of dollars the US government made available in various forms of aid pales compared with the legacy of pre-existing programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid. The levels of US public debt in 2024 are similar as a percentage of GDP to what they were in 1945, in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. But that has more to do with the long-term burdens of welfare programmes and defence spending than with the response to Covid.In a war, the young fight and give up their lives to keep the old safe, who in return pledge to make life better for those who are being asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. It is part of what creates a sense of mutual obligation between the generations. In Covid, it was the old who lost their lives, but it was still the young who made many of the sacrifices, in lost employment and educational opportunities. That makes the tradeoff more complicated. Its legacy has not been a new intergenerational compact. If anything, political differences between the generations are wider than ever, and Covid has exacerbated them. The young have not been repaid for their sacrifice with the kinds of promises that tend to follow an actual war: better housing, greater educational access, full employment. This is in part because the price paid by the younger generation has proved far harder to quantify than the physical toll the disease took on the old. Who owes whom for what? This was a war with no obvious winners.Except, perhaps, those politicians who saw what might come next. In October 2022, as his invasion of Ukraine was stalling, Vladimir Putin told his government coordination council in Moscow that the lesson was clear: Russia needed to translate Covid urgency into military urgency. “We faced certain difficulties and the need to upgrade our work, give it a new momentum and a new character when we were responding to the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. Those lessons had to be taken forward in prosecuting the war. “We need to get rid of those archaic procedures that are preventing us from moving forward at the pace the country needs.” As a first step, Putin declared martial law in the four regions controlled by Russian forces.Covid was not an actual war, though it often felt like one. Nor was Covid a dry run for how to deal with the challenge of the climate crisis, though it occasionally felt like that too. Now we know that Covid was, for some politicians, a dry run for war itself.Covid did not fundamentally change the way we live. The French writer Michel Houellebecq, when asked what impact Covid would have on the future, said: “The same, but worse.” That is perhaps too bleak. It is not all worse. In some respects, life has returned to its previous patterns, for better and for worse. The drivers of change remain the same, even if some of them have accelerated.The pandemic dramatically accelerated some social transformations that were already under way. Working from home was something being facilitated by new technology long before 2020. The pandemic did not create hybrid working, nor did it begin the steady hollowing out of downtown office space. But it brought\\xa0them forward by about a decade.Politics, too, is similar enough to what went before that it seems unlikely future historians will see 2020-21 as representing a sea-change in world affairs. The US and China are more hostile to each other than they were, though the hostility had been growing for more than a decade before 2020. The Middle East is more unstable than it was, electoral politics more fractious, authoritarians more assertive, the planet hotter, the disparities greater. This is somewhat different. But none of it is new. And there is no vaccine for political long Covid, any more than there is for the longer form of the disease itself. Its effects are too sporadic and its triggers still too poorly understood for that.But in one respect, the political consequences of Covid in 2024 might yet come to look decisive in the history of the 21st century. The politician who paid the highest electoral price for the pandemic was Donald Trump. At the start of 2020 he was well set for re-election: the US economy was relatively strong, his base was relatively happy (above all with his nominations to the supreme court), and the Democrats were unable to agree on a candidate to oppose him. Covid changed all that. Trump handled it badly – he never got his message straight – and even some of his supporters noticed. The economy suffered. The Democrats rallied behind Joe Biden, who did not have to suffer the physical stresses of a full campaign because most forms of campaigning were impossible. Trump lost, but only narrowly – without Covid he would almost certainly have won.For the many people inside and outside the US who found Trump beyond the pale, his removal from office looked like one of the few blessings of the pandemic. Yet had Trump won in 2020 he would have been, like most second-term US presidents, something of a lame duck. He had achieved little by way of serious reform in his first term: a second term would have likely been even more underwhelming, since Trump runs on resentment, which re-election would have done much to defuse. Now, in 2024, we would be looking at the back of Trump, and at a new generation of candidates, some of whom might have been offering something new. ‘We can’t go back to normal’: how will coronavirus change the world? Instead, a narrow defeat in 2020 – coupled with his insistence that he had been robbed – has given Trump all the resentment he needs. It is Biden who has inherited the problems of a post-Covid world and the challenge of defending his administration from the resentments that have built up. A second Trump term coming after an interlude of four years, during which time he and his supporters have been making sure they won’t get fooled again, and his opponents have been looking for ways to have him jailed, is a far more serious prospect. The stakes are much higher. The damage could be far greater.This year is the busiest year around the world in the history of electoral democracy: more than 4 billion people are entitled to vote in elections from India to Ireland to Mexico. It is one sign that Covid, which put so many democratic freedoms on hold, did not do so permanently. But the US presidential election in November still has the potential to outweigh all that. Trump is by no means certain to win. Yet if he does, and if he decides this time to make good on his promise to change the way the US is governed, by hollowing out the administrative state and by withdrawing US support for Ukraine and for Nato, then Covid will have had a truly lasting impact on\\xa0global politics. At that point, political long Covid will be hard for any of us to escape. • Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.',\n",

       " 'Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has accused his political opponents of trying to undermine his government and influence the outcome of this weekend’s European elections after a judge investigating corruption allegations against his wife summoned her to testify five days before polls open.Sánchez’s wife, Begoña Gómez, is being investigation for alleged corruption and influence-peddling after a complaint by the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue political targets.Manos Limpias has accused Gómez of using her influence as the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course that she ran.Although prosecutors in Madrid have asked the court to throw out the case for lack of evidence – and a report by the Guardia Civil police force found no indication of criminal activity by Gómez – the investigation is proceeding.On Tuesday, a Madrid court ordered Gómez to testify on 5 July – 11 days before witnesses in the case give evidence on 16 July.Hours later, Sánchez, who has always insisted on his wife’s innocence, posted a public letter on X, saying he found the timing of the judge’s announcement odd.“This decision has been announced just five days before elections to the European parliament are held, which is strange,” wrote the prime minister. “Usually, the unwritten rule about not issuing decisions likely to affect the normal development of an election are followed so as not to affect how people vote. But in this case, it’s obvious that practice hasn’t been respected. I will leave the reader to draw their own conclusions.”Sánchez then stepped up his attack on his rightwing and far-right opponents, once again accusing them of waging a baseless smear campaign against his wife in order to drive him out of office. “There is nothing behind this accusation, just an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint,” he wrote.The prime minister paused his public duties for five days at the end of April while he considered whether he wanted to continue in office because of what he termed the “harassment and bullying operation” he and his wife were enduring. He decided to stay.“They are now trying to use illegitimate methods to achieve what they didn’t manage to do at the polls,” Sánchez wrote in Tuesday’s letter, adding: “In the coming days you will be witness to a careful choreography designed by the extreme-right coalition to try to determine the elections and weaken the government. Begoña and I know perfectly well why they’re attacking here. Neither of us is naive. They’re doing it because she’s my partner.”Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of Spain’s conservative People’s party, said the prime minister was indulging in melodrama when he should be offering explanations about his wife’s legal situation. He described the new letter as “another insult to judges, to the media, and to the intelligence of the Spanish people”.Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, was blunter still. “In democratic states, justice is independent,” he wrote in reply. “It is not subject to anyone’s personal interests, nor to any kind of electoral process … If you think this accusation could influence the European elections, maybe you could talk about what’s at stake on 9 June: the future of the European Union.”']"
