Lee is currently the Vice President and Dean of Arizona International. She is a Fellow of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) and serves as the AERA Division J (Postsecondary Education) Vice President. She formerly served as a NAFSA Senior Fellow, US Fulbright Scholar to South Africa, the Chair for the Council of International Higher Education and Board of Directors for the Association for the Study of Higher Education (ASHE). She has participated as a distinguished Global Professor at Korea University and as an international visiting scholar at the City University of London, the University of Pretoria, and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Dr. Lee's research examines how migration policies, geopolitics, and social forces shape inequities in higher education, in the US and abroad. Dr. Lee has investigated university internationalization and partnerships, student and scholar mobility, and scientific collaboration, to name some. Based on her comparative research in the US, Southern Africa, and East Asia, she has introduced widely cited critical frameworks, such as neo-racism and neo-nationalism, to the field. In addition, Dr. Lee’s expertise is regularly sought by national and international news outlets. NPR, Nature, Science, the New York Times, the Atlantic, ABC News, the Wall Street Journal, and Reuters are among the prominent news networks that have quoted Professor Lee and featured her research. Her latest research focuses on the geopolitics of global science, which is covered in her multi-award winning edited book, “U.S. Power in International Higher Education,” published by Rutgers University Press in 2021. Currently, she is undergoing two major studies, one funded by NSF and another in partnership with the Committee of 100, on how international research collaboration can overcome current US-China tensions and the racial profiling of Chinese scientists and students in the US.
